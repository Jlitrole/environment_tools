The "environment_tools" library

A source of truth for information about Yelp's environments.

Generating The Mapping
======================
If you need to generate the location_mapping.yaml file (perhaps because you
changed how Yelp lays out its machines), you must do the following:

1. Ensure that you have a checkout of bind somewhere on the local machine
2. Set the BIND_FILES environment variable to point to the location of the
internal dns records. For example:
    export BIND_FILES=~/pg/bind/zones.internal/
3. Run `make mapping`
4. Get the mapping reviewed, and commit it
